- Import tRPC client from `@/utils/trpc`
- Use `.query()` for read operations, `.mutate()` for write operations
- Always handle loading and error states in components
- Store complete API responses before accessing properties
- Transform data after fetching if component needs different structure
- Never use mock data - always fetch real data from API
- Handle tRPC errors gracefully with try/catch blocks
