# app.build (agent)

**app.build** is an open-source AI agent for generating production-ready full-stack applications from a single prompt.

## What it builds

- **Full-stack web apps** with Bun, React, Vite, Fastify and Drizzle
- **Neon Postgres database** provisioned instantly via API
- **Applications tested** ahead of generation with smoke tests using Playwright
- **GitHub repository** with complete source code
- **CI/CD and deployment** via the [app.build platform](https://github.com/appdotbuild/platform)
- **Automatic validation** with ESLint, TypeScript, and runtime verification

## Try it

```bash
npx @app.build/cli
```

## Architecture

This agent doesn't generate entire applications at once. Instead, it breaks down app creation into small, well-scoped tasks that run in isolated sandboxes:

1. **Database schema generation** - Creates typed database models
2. **API handler logic** - Builds validated Fastify routes
3. **Frontend components** - Generates React UI with proper typing

Each task is validated independently using ESLint, TypeScript compilation, test execution, and runtime logs before being accepted.

## Repository structure

This is the **agent** repository containing the core code generation engine and runtime environment. The CLI and platform code are available in the [platform repository](link-to-platform-repo).
